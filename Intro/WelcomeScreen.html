You will be in the role of a division manager in an organization. You and two other division managers have to allocate parts of your individual budgets to a central project. All of you have to allocate budget to the project to ensure the success. The two other division managers are also participants of this study. The success of the project will determine the bonus payment you will receive from this study.<br/><br/>

In the following, we will explain the general set-up of this study. After all participants have read the instructions, you will meet in a video meeting and can discuss your allocations for 5 minutes. After this, you have to decide about your budget contribution to the project.<br/><br/>
